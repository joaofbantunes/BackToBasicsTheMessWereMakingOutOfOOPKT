# Back to basics: the mess we're making out of OOP - Kotlin Edition
Kotlin version of the demo code used in [the original presentation](https://github.com/joaofbantunes/BackToBasicsTheMessWereMakingOutOfOOP).

I have no experience in Kotlin, so I'm pretty sure this is far from idiomatic code. Hopefully I'll improve it as I learn new things.
